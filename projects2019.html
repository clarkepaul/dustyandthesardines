					<h2>Child &amp; dog safety gate</h2>
					<p>I've added a child safety gate at the top of the stairs to avoid kids/dog running out on the road if the door is open. This should allow us to leave the door open and allow the breeze to flow through without the added danger.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Skylight blind</h2>
					<p>To avoid the sun beaming through the skylight and air vent in the morning I created two covers to block out the light. The wood from larger of the two warped after a few hot days, so another solution is going to be needed soon, it will hold up for now though.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Cup shelf</h2>
					<p>A minor improvement to store more cups under the bench top, which helps to utilize some empty space and helps to hide the sink bowl at the same time.</p>
					<p>At the same time I hacked up a basket under the sink so it could act as a vertical plate stacker. It seems to be working well so I  might try to think of a more elegant way of doing this so the plates don't move so much.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Awning bust, and fixed again :)</h2>
					<p>On our last trip to Kaitoki we discovered that the awning doesn't retract as it should. When winding it in you can hear a cog slipping, we really needed that awning as it was too hot in the bus. I've figured out it was a 2005 modal Thule Omnistor and was able to order a new part (Cranking Gear Assembly) and install it prior to heading away for summer.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Gumboot rack</h2>
					<p>Since the boot of the bus is pretty much our garage and a little bit of a wet area (mindful of the electrics though), a gumboot rack made sense to keep them from flying about. Super simple and accessible along with heavy our rain gear.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Coal BBQ storage box</h2>
					<p>The bus has its own coal BBQ stored in the boot and I've fashioned a couple of old fruit wooden boxes to house it along with coal, paper, wood etc. Mixed success so far, I really need a coal starter as I'm not patient enough.</p>

					<h2>Babies cot and change table</h2>

					<p>Something pretty major has just changed in our lives—we have a new addition to the family. Wee Leon has joined the adventure, and what better excuse to adjust the sleeping quarters of the bus again? I've added a little platform for a Babyco Moses Basket to float above our bed, the platform also doubles as a changing table when the basket is removed, and the changing mat is also removable so we can use it elsewhere. The platform is repurposed from the changing table part of a Caraboo cot. It's suspended from the top bunk by a couple of straps and can be levelled as required if the bus isn't.</p>
					<p>After a test run today we found a perfect solution, plenty of space for our feet without bumping the baby and enough headroom to get him in and out. Best of all it sways which can be used to rock the baby to sleep.</p>

					<h2>Bed headboard and headboard light</h2>
					<p>Because there's a bit of a gap between the double mattress and the back wall, I've made a headboard to fill the gap. The headboard is made from an old foam mattress, which makes for a pretty comfy headboard and provides an extra thermal layer between the sleeping area and the back of the bus.</p>
					<p>Kim had some fabric lying around which I used to cover the foam and I had a board up in the attic to give the headboard some strength. I sliced the mattress up with an electric bread knife to form the shape, with special attention to ensure the bunk still goes up and down by splitting the headboard into the main piece and a smaller piece that can be used if the bunk is up or if the bunk is down (against the wall).</p>
					<p>Added a bendy <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33044272846.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dPD8Y3u">LED reading light</a> above the headboard, which can be positioned for the top bunk or the main bed. Apart from being positionable, it also has bright/warm white as well as dimming, making it perfect for our purpose.</p>
					<p>I was thinking I might splash out at some stage to purchase some thick wool felt material to cover it, but for now there are more important things to do.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Bus tunes</h2>
					<p>Something I used to do when I was younger was making mix tapes for road trips and holidays, bring back the old days I say! Occasionally you'd find an old playlist, and it brings back those memories.</p>
					<p>I've dug out my old iPod fully still loaded with tunes from at least 12 years ago, and my bag of mini-discs, some of those mixes are well worth digging back up. They'll plug straight into the stereo system, so should be good for the drive.</p>

					<h2>Relining the bedroom roof in ply</h2>
					<a class="lightbox" href="./images/gallery/ceiling_down.jpg" title="Taking down the ceiling">
						<div style="background-image: url('./images/gallery/ceiling_down.jpg');"></div>
					</a>
					<p>I had to remove some of the boards and carpet on the back wall to put in the bunk bed, while I was at it I decided to remove the ceiling fabric as it was sagging anyway—so it looks like I'm pretty much redoing the whole back bedroom now. On the opposite side of the bunk, there is an old large air duct which is pretty much an empty void, I've removed it as well which I'll replace with an open shelf.</p>
					<p>I was going to reline the ceiling with Gaboon (Okume) ply, but decided at the last minute to go Kauri. I can slowly work my way to the front of the bus with a similar style throughout.</p>
					<p>I'll be adding two strips of LED lighting down the roofline and some USB ports to the back wall for mobile phones. I think even my laptop can charge from those USB ports? Although we have an inverter on board anyway.</p>
					<p>It's all taking a lot longer than I anticipated, all those curves and fitting it around the skylights, lights, light switches, and air vents. I added a vent cover in the rear, which I'll need to replicate at the front when I get that far.<p>
					<p>Update: so apparently Kauri ply comes from Fiji and all supplies to NZ has stopped, so now I potentially can't get any more. When I purchased it, I was assured more would be coming, but I've rung around NZ to find more, but there isn't any! It's all at the Fijian docks in containers, with some legal battle. What to do? Continue with what I have, or swap it out now for another wood.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>LED lights and power points</h2>
					<img loading=lazyclass="simple-image border-radius-8 right-50" src="./images/gallery/USB.png" />
					<p>With the plywood saga going on, I've moved on to wiring up the LED light strips which run down either side of the main sheet of ply running down the middle of the ceiling. I've got one side fitted and working, using a remote or phone you have the ability to dim the lights and change colours. I plan to fit another strip today above the bunk bed. So after that I'll move back to the fitting of the remaining ply I've got left.</p>
					<p>I planned on installing multiple <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32950195479.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dPD8Y3u">USB charge stations</a> throughout the bus, but I've only started by installing one at the top of the bed.</p><br />

						<div style="background-image: url('./images/gallery/GPS_tracker.png');"></div>
					</a>
					<h2>GPS tracker installation</h2>
					<p>I've been pretty casual with parking my bus in places that aren't the safest, for a little bit more peace of mind I've purchased a GPS tracker for the bus.</p>
					<p>It's a fairly simple device that will alert me if it moves, or by sending it an SMS it will let me know its location.</p>
					<p>Purchased off AliExpress for about $30, and so far it's been easy to set up. I have the bus being tracked on a map, which is useful for seeing the distance travelled and recording the route we take.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Movie projector</h2>
					<p>After a bit of research I purchased a projector for the home which we could also use with bus outings.</p>
					<p>The idea is that it'll be used on either the outside of the bus or on a projector screen that pulls down from above the kitchen bench. I'm looking forward to trying it out properly, I just need some good family movies downloaded now.</p>
					<p>Word of warning, it heats up quite a lot, so not the best for indoor use in a small space on a hot day (we did try). Also, during summer it hasn't been dark enough until after 9 pm, Isaac is already in bed by then. It might get more use in the in-between seasons when it goes dark a little early or it's a bit cooler indoors to run the projector.</p>

					<h2>Kids bunk bed</h2>
					<p>I'm building a bunk bed for the kids above the main fixed double bed. We're keeping all the sleeping areas in the back section of the bus so the dining area can be used in the evenings. The bunk will be easily stored away by folding into the wall like a Murphy Bed.
						<p>I've purchased a trundler bed from TradeMe which I'll use for the frame. I've had to take away the cupboards above the main double bed to make space, and I'll also be moving the TV to the other side of the bus (I've removed it all together for now).</p>
						<p>Next will be to create a guard rail to stop Isaac falling out of the bed.</p>
