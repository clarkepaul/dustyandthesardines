					<h2>Water filter tap fitted</h2>
					<p>With two little kids on board I wanted to feel more confident about the cleanliness of our water sources as we travel around, and that includes the cleanliness of our water tank. Who knows what the tank looks like on the inside, although it is a stainless tank which is said to be a great material to limit bacteria growth.</p>
					<p>Time was short before going away so I just got a professional to come and fit it. Filter should last 1-2 with the amount we use it.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Split the top bunk into two beds to accommodate Leon</h2>
					<p>Because Leon outgrew both of his previous basinets I had to come up with a new idea. I ended up creating a little enclosure for him on the back part of the top bunk. Luckily Isaac is still small enough for this to work out. I only built this two days before we headed off on our big trip. Leon loved his little space, apart from us bumping his head getting him in and out and the mild heat in the early evenings.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Indoor hammock</h2>
					<p>I've had a hammock lying around since forever, it got some use on camping trips on the odd occasion when we could find the right spot but that doesn't happen much. I picked two pillars to attach a hammock above the front seats of the bus. The hammock just misses the gear stick and can be left in place when not in use or driving by pinning it up behind the sun visorsâ€”works a treat. Rain or shine its a nice spot to be, unfortunately for me Isaac seems to get irst dibs.</p>

					<h2>Swivel TV embedded within the wall (work in progress)</h2>
					<p>With less than two weeks left before we head off on our summer holiday trip, I'm tearing things apart again to fit the TV into the wall so that it spins 360deg. This will mean it can be used from both ends of the bus.</p>
					<p>For a long time I've been planning this spinning TV. It was extremely tricky and messy, but its strong, and I'm happy with the result so far. The TV spins freely, and has a little stopper which fixes it in place when driving. It's going to be finished with a surface layer of ply to clean things up. It was well worth the effort and used a fair bit on our <a href="../post-15.html">Christmas break trip</a>.</p>

					<h2>Hub seal oil leak</h2>
					<p>It wasn't exactly the hub seal, but another seal in the rear wheel. Easy minor fix done by North City Diesel in Porirua. Its not an easy to drop the bus off at the mechanics and travel back via train, I need to find an easier way back like putting the motorbike on the back.</p>

					<h2>Tidied up 12v power and sockets in sleeping area</h2>
					<p>I'm prepping some sockets and power for the TV to be built into the wall. I will be adding a shelf for smaller items which will hide the ports and switches and provide a good place for charging phones and keeping smaller items away from the kids.</p>
					<br />
					<h2>Storage box by driver</h2>
					<p>There is a constant effort which goes into maximising space within the bus. There was some dead space next to the drivers seat so I've' built a box to house bits and bobs for electronics and keep them out of the way.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Wool insulation part 1</h2>
					<p>The project continues to grow, because I am aiming to reline and redo the cabinets, I decided I might as well do insulation in the walls. After much investigation into the in and outs of materials and thermal barriers I decided to go with a product called Terra Lana which is a blend of natural wool and polyester. It holds its shape as a batt and was easy to split down the middle to make it the same thickness as the wall cavities. So far I've only done the right wall from the back of the living quarters up through to the seating area. The shower area will be done later when that is renovated and the front area would require all the seats to come out which I'm not ready to do as yet. Now that that section of insulation is complete it can be lined with ply (stacked up in my living room waiting for more time).</p>

					<h2>More 240v plugs added</h2>
					<p>We added some 240v outlets under the dinette table as we previously only had plugs at the kitchen bench. This meant if you were using a computer at the table, power cables ran across the isleâ€”not the best situation with small kids. It's the perfect time with insuation currently being fitted.</p>

					<h2>Maintenance</h2>
					<p>The bus took a trip to Palmerston North where we have a mechanic. This time I had a lesson on how to do a COF precheck myself, but also we had some issues with the clutch looked at (clutch master cylinder and clutch no fluid).</p>
					<p>Rust was found unfortunately, which I will need to see to, and he did a oil change for me as it would have been overdue.</p>

					<h2>Ply delivery</h2>
					<p>I wasn't able to get hold of the Kauri play I originally started with so I've made a pretty dramatic change to Euro Poplar Ply. It wasn't what I originally wanted, but I need to move on. It comes in loads of thicknesses and even though it's really pale it can be lacquered or stained if need be, it's lightweight and recommended for RV's.</p><p> I thought the Kauri had loads of character and warmth, but I don't have much choice but make a change.</p>
					<p>Now my living room has a stack load of ply behind the couch waiting to be cut up and installed.</p>
					<p>I also manage to score some Birch ply from Trademe which I think will be used for draw fronts and doors as its nicer looking and already finished with a finish for protecting.</p>

					<h2>Baby bassinet</h2>
					<p>Leon has out grown the Moses basket so I've fitted a bassinet in the same spot. At just under a metre long he should be able to fit for at least another year.</p>
					<p>I bought it second hand off Trademe, I've replaced the two ends so I still have all the parts to reasemble to its original state. It leaves plenty of space underneath for our feet. The side folds down to easily get Leon in and out.</p>
					<p>He's had naps in it and an overnighter already and it worked perfectly. Isaacs painted the replacement ends of the cot so it's pretty unique at the moment. Bus is a mess at the moment from the fitting the insulation.</p>

					<h2>Kids seat pockets</h2>
					<p>Space for teddies, books, iPad and bits and pieces. All at hands reach for those long drives. I'm, using vertical felt vertical grow pockets which we've had for a while, but never ended up using in the garden.</p>
					<p>I've also fitted pockets to the back of the driver's seat as well, which has USB charging, tissue holder, and an assortment of other shaped pockets for bits and pieces.</p>

					<h2>Moving on to a different type of ply</h2>
					<p>So after about 6 months trying to source more Kauri ply I've come to the realization that I need to move on to another wood type because it's too hard to get. Although Kauri was the look I was going for it seems its not going to be available in the near future as they've stopped importing it into the country. So onto selecting a replacement, I'm considering Euro Poplar, Birch, Gaboon, or Meranti.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Driver cup holders</h2>
					<p>I've now got a couple options for drinks in the cockpit. Good for the on-the-go coffee or cold drink.</p>

					<h2>Diesel filter cap rethreaded</h2>
					<p>Due to an airlock in diesel fuel line we had a few temporary breakdowns. Managed to get help from the previous owner over the phone who helped to clear the lines. During the process I found some bolts on the diesel filters de-threaded. Made a temporary fix by borrowing plumbing tape from someone at a campsite which meant I could get it out to a mechanic prior to taking it to the Hawkes Bay. I got my first taste of bus maintenance, pretty stressful, but it all worked out. I got covered in diesel in the process as well as through the isle of the bus.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Skylight blind v2</h2>
					<p>So my first attempt at creating a wooden skylight blind failed back in Dec 2019, it was too heavy, bulky and the wood warped. Version two is some blackout blind material with a few rods sewn in to keep it tight when up. So far so good, it folds up nicely, keeps things super dark, and is easy to install.</p>
					<br />

					<h2>Festoon lights for the awning</h2>
					<p>I've created a place to just plug these directly within the boot. Haven't tested them out properly in the evening as I'm not sure if they will attract the mozzies.</p>

					<h2>Blackout thermal magnetic curtains</h2>
					<p>I've started to build wooden frames around the bedroom windows so I'm able to screw magnets to them. A <a href="https://www.bunnings.co.nz/wrap-move-1-8-x-3-2m-premium-moving-blanket_p2610107">wool moving blanket</a> acting as both a thermal barrier and blackout blind will snap into place by <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000865162801.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.16004c4d2ziKTR">neodymium magnets</a> for easy attachment and removal. I've also got waterproof and blackout material to attach to them, but I don't think I'll need them as its super dark already with just the blanket it seems dry enough to avoid damp and mold (I'll keep an eye on them).</p>
					<p>I'm leaving the original curtains in place as well, which are more for privacy during the day. The magnet blinds are to really make the sleeping area extra dark for day time naps by the kids and those long sleep ins after one too many nightcaps.</p>
